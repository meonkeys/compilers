SYNOPSIS

    cd src
    make

PREREQUISITES

    * Java compiler and virtual machine conformant with the Java 6
      specification.
    * POSIX-compatible Make

EXECUTION DETAILS

    Typing "make" in the source directory should compile and run all unit
    tests.

    * The Java compiler is assumed to be /usr/bin/javac
    * The Java virtual machine is assumed to be /usr/bin/java

    If these paths are incorrect, edit src/Makefile before compiling and
    running unit tests.

    The code is known to work on Ubuntu 8.10 with Sun Java 6 and GNU Make.

CODE DETAILS

    The primary changes were in parser.Parser:
    
    * term() was modified to support '*' and '/' operators.
    * expr() and term() were modified to support constant folding via the
      fold() method in the same class

    Additionally, a unit test framework was added by:

    * modifying the Main class so compilation could be programmatically
      directed
    * adding Main#reset() (and callees) so static global state for the compiler
      frontend could be cleared
    * creating a Test class
