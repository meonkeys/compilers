AUTHORS

SYNOPSIS

    make

PREREQUISITES

    * POSIX-compatible Make
    * GCC
    * Flex

EXECUTION DETAILS

    Typing "make" in the top-level or src directory should compile and run all
    unit tests except memory leak checks. A successful return code and the
    appearance of "ALL TESTS PASSED" should print out in the console.

    * flex and gcc assumed present in PATH

    If these paths are incorrect, edit Makefile before compiling and running
    unit tests.

    The code is known to work on Ubuntu 8.10.

CODE DETAILS

    Assignment description:

    The hashtable used was derived from Christopher Clark's "C Hash Table",
    freely available under the new BSD license at
    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cwc22/hashtable/ . Changes were made to accomodate
    the strictest possible GCC compilation options.

BUGS

    Due to a limitation in the hashtable implementation, the symbol table 
    uses only fixed-length records for keys and values.
