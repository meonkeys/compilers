To create a new unit test that will automatically be found and run by
"unit_test.sh":
1. Create a file ending with ".in" in this directory with C-- source.
   Failing tests start with "bad_" by convention.
2. Create a corresponding ".out" file containing the expected parser output.

To test execution:
1. Create a file ending with ".out2" containing execution output (minus the
   version information header output by SPIM).
2. If read() is called, create a file ending with ".stdin" containing
   content to be sent to standard input.

NOTE: These are end-to-end tests which use the filesystem. True "unit" tests
would generally test individual functions or methods, so these are technically
"integration", "acceptance" or "smoke" tests.
